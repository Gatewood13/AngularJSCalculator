# AngularJSCalculator
Calculator made using Angular.js

This Calculator was inspired by this tutorial: http://rabidgadfly.com/2012/12/angularjs-simple-calculator/

I edited the styling and added functionality for dividing and multiplying. 
Also edited file structure to include the script from a seperate file. 

Feel free to use this in any way you would like to.
